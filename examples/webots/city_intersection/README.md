# Webots Generic Examples

An example showing how to use Scenic to generate training data for an autonomous car. In this example the ego car is approaching an intersection where it has an obligation to yield, with another car crossing the intersection. At regular intervals the ego car's camera output will be saved, and tagged with whether or not the crossing car is visible or not visible.

These examples are intended to be run **without** the ``--2d`` flag.
